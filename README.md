# Hardwork-Pays-Off
# Predicting Exam Scores using Machine Learning
## we are using here Linear Regression and also using Gradient Descent to get the best fit line. 
Since you are a student, 
you are expected to work hard and get better results than others. 
To track your time and expected performance in the Machine Learning Challenge,
prince sharma has asked to you install walkatime on your device which is an efficient time tracking tool to track your daily coding activity. 
It measures how much time you have spend on coding daily.

# Challenge

In this challenge, Prateek bhayia gives you wakatime data of his past students and how they performed in the evaluation exam. Your task is to predict the score you will get given the amount of time you spend on coding daily.

Input You are given one feature corresponding to time noted by wakatime.

Output A scalar denoting the level of perfomance student achived by devoting the given time.

Download the training data and upload your predictions for the testcases given below.

## Before submitting please check the list below:

   1. The column names or headers of submission file must match with that given in sample submission file.

   2. Datatype of the columns of submission file must match with that of the given sample_submission file.

   3. The number of rows must be equal to given test cases and number of columns must be equal to the columns given in the           sample submission file.
