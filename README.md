# Hardwork-Pays-Off
# Predicting Exam Scores using Machine Learning
## we are using here Linear Regression and also using Gradient Descent to get the best fit line. 
Since you are a student, 
you are expected to work hard and get better results than others. 
To track your time and expected performance in the Machine Learning Challenge,
prince sharma has asked to you install walkatime on your device which is an efficient time tracking tool to track your daily coding activity. 
It measures how much time you have spend on coding daily.
